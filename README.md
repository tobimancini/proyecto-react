On this website, anyone will be able to create their own user, and navigate in between different categories of products, for then make a purchase.
Old purchases data would also be available for each user. 
It must be taken into account that each product has a specific stock, and once it ends, it would not be possible to buy it anymore.

The libraries used in this site are: 
- SweetAlert, used to give the user a better expierence while receiving an alert.
- Firebase, used to act as a backend storage, for all products and users data.
